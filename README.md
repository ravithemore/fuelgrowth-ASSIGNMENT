# 🔄 Workflow Stages

## 1️⃣ Extraction Phase
**Purpose:** Downloads videos from the provided dataset.  
- **Input:** CSV file (`Assignment Data - Sheet1.csv`) with video URLs.  
- **Process:**  
  - Downloads videos into the `videos` folder, with filenames matching their row indices (e.g., `0.mp4`, `1.mp4`).  
- **Output:** `videos` folder containing the downloaded videos.  

---

## 2️⃣ Processing Phase
**Purpose:** Identifies unique influencers and calculates metrics.  
- **Input:** Downloaded videos from the `videos` folder.  
- **Process:**  
  - Detects faces using `face_recognition`.  
  - Saves unique faces in the `influencer_faces` folder.  
  - Calculates:  
    - **Average Performance:** Computed from dataset scores.  
    - **Reliability:** Measured using test-retest reliability.  
- **Output:**  
  - `influencer_faces` folder with unique face images.  
  - CSV file (`sorted_unique_influencers_with_reliability.csv`) summarizing influencer metrics.  

---

## 3️⃣ Analysis Phase
**Purpose:** Creates a professional PDF summarizing the analysis.  
- **Input:**  
  - `sorted_unique_influencers_with_reliability.csv`.  
  - Face images from the `influencer_faces` folder.  
- **Output:**  
  - 📄 PDF file (`influencer_table.pdf`) containing:  
    - Influencer ID.  
    - Influencer Face (if available).  
    - Average Performance.  
    - Reliability.
